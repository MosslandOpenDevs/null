# Scenario: Neon Joseon

> *"What if the Joseon Dynasty never fell, but instead became a cyberpunk megastate in 2145?"*

## Seed Prompt

```
Era: 2145 AD
Base civilization: Joseon Dynasty (Korea)
Divergence: Joseon never fell; industrialized independently in 1800s
Tech level: Cyberpunk (neural implants, AI governance, megacities)
Population: 150 agents
Factions: Neo-Confucian Technocrats, Underground Hackers, Royal AI Loyalists, Foreign Trade Guild
Conflict: Debate over mandatory neural implant law
```

## Phase 1: Genesis

The Genesis Node processes the seed and generates:

- **World Config:** Neon Joseon — a hyper-technological kingdom blending Confucian hierarchy with cybernetic augmentation
- **150 Agent Personas:** Scholars, merchants, hackers, royal officials, foreign diplomats — each with unique backgrounds, beliefs, and agendas
- **Initial State:** The Royal AI Council has proposed mandatory neural implants for all citizens. Society is divided.

## Phase 2: Simulation

### Epoch 1 — The Debate Begins
- Neo-Confucian Technocrats argue implants uphold social harmony through shared knowledge
- Underground Hackers warn of surveillance and loss of individual thought
- Royal AI Loyalists push for immediate implementation as royal decree
- Foreign Trade Guild sees profit opportunity but fears trade regulation

### Epoch 2 — Alliances Form
- Hackers and some scholars form the "Free Mind Coalition"
- Technocrats ally with Loyalists to form the "Harmony Collective"
- A Chaos Joker agent leaks fabricated evidence of implant mind control

### Epoch 3 — Crisis
- External Reality Injection: Real-world news about brain-computer interface developments is transformed into an in-world discovery
- Public opinion shifts. Protests in the virtual streets of Neo-Hanyang

### Epoch 4 — Resolution (or not)
- The Hive Mind documents the full history: debates, alliances, betrayals, and outcomes
- Canon is established for key events; disputed claims become Legends

## Phase 3: Documentation

The Hive Mind generates:
- Wiki pages for each faction, key agent, and major event
- A timeline of the Neural Implant Crisis
- Knowledge graph connecting agents, factions, events, and outcomes
- Exportable dataset of all agent decisions and reasoning

## Phase 4: Export

Available outputs:
- **JSON:** Full structured data of all conversations, decisions, and wiki entries
- **CSV:** Agent behavior patterns, sentiment analysis, faction dynamics
- **Wiki:** Self-contained wiki site of Neon Joseon history
- **Narrative:** AI-generated prose summary of the simulation
