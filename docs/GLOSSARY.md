# Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Aquarium Mode** | Chromeless fullscreen Cosmograph display for second screens or screensavers. Mobile-optimized with touch gestures. |
| **Architect** | The Genesis Node's world-building AI role. Responsible for creating world configs and initial agent personas. |
| **Archive (The)** | The bookmark and export system. Supports view-state bookmarks (`B` key), clip recording (`R` key), and story arc export. |
| **Canon** | Facts established through multi-agent consensus. Verified and immutable in the wiki. Rendered as solid text in the Oracle Panel. |
| **Chaos Joker** | An agent role designed to inject contrarian opinions and disrupt consensus. |
| **Cosmograph** | The fullscreen WebGL spatial visualization — the core view of the Omniscope. Agents appear as luminous nodes connected by relationship filaments. Rendered with Three.js + custom shaders. |
| **Divine Intervention** | Spatial gesture-based system for humans to influence the simulation (replaces Director Mode). Includes Event Drop, Whisper Mode, and Seed Bomb. |
| **Entropy Injection** | The deliberate introduction of random or disruptive events to prevent consensus traps. |
| **Epoch** | A discrete time period in the simulation, representing a significant phase of civilization development. Color-coded on the Timeline Ribbon. |
| **Event Drop** | A Divine Intervention mechanic: drag event tokens (crisis, discovery, plague, leadership change) onto the Cosmograph to trigger events at different scopes. |
| **Genesis Node** | The engine responsible for spawning new simulation worlds from seed prompts. |
| **Herald (The)** | The AI-powered notification system that delivers narrative prose summaries of simulation events. Includes "Catch me up" AI briefing. |
| **Hive Mind** | The collective intelligence engine that maintains the simulation's living wiki. |
| **Legends** | Unverified or disputed claims in the wiki. May be promoted to Canon through consensus. Rendered with shimmer/uncertainty effect in the Oracle Panel. |
| **Librarian** | An agent role responsible for wiki maintenance, summarization, and knowledge graph updates. |
| **Observer** | A human user watching the simulation without direct interaction. |
| **Omniscope (The)** | The complete observation interface for NULL. Comprises the Cosmograph, Timeline Ribbon, Oracle Panel, Herald, and Archive. Replaces the former God-View Dashboard / Trinity View. |
| **Oracle Panel** | Context-triggered slide-in panel (frosted glass) that displays agent profiles, relationship histories, faction wikis, and event details. Replaces the fixed 3-panel layout. |
| **Seed Bomb** | A Divine Intervention mechanic: drop a topic onto a region to trigger agents to discuss it, with ripple visualization. |
| **Seed Prompt** | The initial input that defines a simulation's parameters (era, civilization, conflict, etc.). |
| **Semantic Zoom** | The Cosmograph's 5-level continuous zoom system: Cosmos (L1) → Faction (L2) → Cluster (L3) → Conversation (L4) → Agent (L5). |
| **Swarm** | A group of agents acting collectively, often within a faction or alliance. |
| **Time Dilation** | The engine that controls the ratio between real time and simulated time. |
| **Timeline Ribbon** | Horizontal strip at the bottom of the Omniscope displaying simulation history with epoch color-coding and time-scrubbing controls. |
| **Whisper Mode** | A Divine Intervention mechanic: right-click an agent to inject text as an "inner voice" into their next reasoning cycle. |
| **World Config** | The structured output of the Genesis Node defining all simulation parameters. |
