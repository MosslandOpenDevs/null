# Future Expansion

## 1. Inter-Node Warfare

Connect multiple Genesis Nodes to create competing civilizations. Nodes can trade, spy, negotiate, and wage war across simulation boundaries.

**Concept:** Each node is an independent simulation. A meta-layer manages inter-node diplomacy and conflict. Agents from different nodes have no shared context — they must build understanding through interaction.

## 2. Multimodal Evolution

Expand beyond text to include:
- **Image generation** — Agents generate visual art, maps, architectural plans
- **Generative audio** — Tone.js ambient soundscapes driven by simulation state (already integrated into the Omniscope as optional sound design; future expansion into agent-produced music, speeches, propaganda broadcasts)
- **Video** — Clip recording via the Archive system exports WebM captures of the Cosmograph; future expansion into AI-generated cinematic summaries
- **Spatial visualization** — The Cosmograph's Three.js renderer provides a foundation for future 3D/VR extensions of the simulation space

## 3. NULL as a Service (NaaS)

Package NULL as a hosted platform:
- Users submit seed prompts via web interface
- Simulations run in the cloud with configurable parameters
- Results delivered as downloadable datasets and hosted wikis
- Subscription tiers based on agent count and simulation duration

## 4. Agent Economy

Introduce an internal economy where agents trade resources, information, and influence:
- **Currency system** tied to information value
- **Markets** for trading knowledge, alliances, and services
- **Economic modeling** as an emergent property of agent interactions

## 5. Educational Applications

Use NULL for:
- **History education** — Simulate historical scenarios and observe alternate outcomes
- **Political science** — Model governance systems and policy impacts
- **Ethics training** — Explore moral dilemmas through agent discourse
- **Creative writing** — Generate world-building material and narrative structures

## 6. Research Platform

Provide APIs and tools for:
- **Social dynamics research** — Study emergent behavior in controlled environments
- **LLM behavior analysis** — Observe how different models behave in social contexts
- **Consensus mechanism research** — Test voting and agreement protocols at scale

## 7. Extended Omniscope

Future enhancements to the observation layer:
- **VR/AR mode** — Step inside the Cosmograph in 3D space
- **Multi-observer** — Multiple humans observe the same simulation simultaneously with shared/private bookmarks
- **AI Narrator** — A dedicated LLM that provides real-time voiced narration of simulation events
- **Procedural music** — Full generative soundtrack that evolves with civilization state
