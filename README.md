## Overview

Synthetic social simulation and reverse-inference engine for emergent outcomes.

Focuses on explainable candidate scenarios rather than single deterministic answers.

## Why This Project

This repository exists to provide a practical, production-oriented foundation with clear operational visibility and repeatable workflows.

## Core Capabilities

- Structured runtime behavior with deterministic checks
- Ops-oriented scripts for health verification and reporting
- Clean handoff between development, validation, and reporting
- Incremental enhancements designed for continuous operation loops

## Tech Stack

`Python, Next.js, Docker, PostgreSQL (planned)`

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
docker compose up -d
```

## Operations

```bash
bash scripts/ops-check.sh
```

## Roadmap

- Improve monitoring depth and trend-based diagnostics
- Expand automation and report schema consistency
- Strengthen failure-mode handling and recovery behavior

## Security & Privacy

- Do not commit secrets, tokens, or private infrastructure details.
- Keep screenshots sanitized (no personal identifiers, no credential surfaces).
- Generated README images in this repo are synthetic and privacy-safe.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. Please keep changes focused, tested, and operationally verifiable.
